32.367159, -86.244978

If my math is correct:

32.375988 -86.244978 should be 3000 feet away
32.367159, -86.239501

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 1/25/15 work above this ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6

The above values are incorrect, i have Lat and long swapped, and im short by about 300'

East West = Width = X = Change in Longitude
North South = Height = Y = Change in Latitude
